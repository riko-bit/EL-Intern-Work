# 🚀 Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

## ✅ Objective
Learn how to clean and prepare raw data for machine learning. The Titanic dataset was used to demonstrate the end-to-end process of data preprocessing.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Dataset
**Titanic Dataset**  
Source: [Kaggle Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)  
Contains passenger data with attributes like age, gender, ticket class, fare paid, and survival status.

---

## 🔧 Steps Performed

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Loaded the dataset
   - Identified null values and data types

2. **Missing Value Handling**
   - Dropped irrelevant columns: `Cabin`, `Ticket`, `Name`, `PassengerId`
   - Imputed `Age` with median, and `Embarked` with mode

3. **Categorical Encoding**
   - Applied Label Encoding to `Sex` and `Embarked`

4. **Feature Scaling**
   - Used `StandardScaler` to normalize `Age` and `Fare`

5. **Outlier Detection and Removal**
   - Visualized boxplots for `Age` and `Fare`
   - Removed outliers using the IQR method

## 📉 Boxplot Analysis

![Boxplot Output](Output.png)

- **Age:** Shows several outliers above the upper whisker, indicating some passengers were significantly older than average.
- **Fare:** Shows a large number of high-end outliers — some passengers paid disproportionately high fares.
- These outliers were removed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) filtering method to ensure data quality.

## 📈 Output Summary
- **Original Dataset Shape:** `(891, 12)`
- **Final Cleaned Dataset Shape:** e.g., `(850, 7)`
- Categorical variables encoded, nulls handled, outliers removed, features standardized

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Identified and handled missing data effectively
- Used encoding and scaling techniques for preprocessing
- Understood the importance of outlier detection using visualization
- Cleaned data is ready for machine learning model development
